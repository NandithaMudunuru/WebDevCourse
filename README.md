## My Journey
I started off with some experience in coding with python, matlab and tiny bit of fortran. With my growing interest for coding I wanted to pick up web development as a hobby. So far this course has been really useful since it mainly focuses on work flow for web development. It swiftly covers all the different components that come together in making a web site or an app. I hope by the end of the course I will have atleast one fully functional website (atleast my personal website if not for anything else  _:)  )
